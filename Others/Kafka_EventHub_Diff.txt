1) Kafka is self managed and can do operations ourself  but EventHub completely managed my Azure

2) In future, if we want to change our services from cloud to some other clouds or On-premise then Kafka Is good option than EventHub.

3) Kafka as a IAAS and EventHub is PAAS.

4) functionally and capability wise Azure Event Hub and Apache Kafka both are similar

5) If using On-primises in environment and Kafka might be good option and if using all services of Azure then EventHub can be good option

6) Kafka Has many connectors to directly get the events like JDBC connector and ElsaticSearch

7) Message Size in EVentHub is 256kb, No limit in Kafka

8) Integrations of Azure Stream nalytics,Azure SQLDB,Azure Data Lake,Azure Machine  is handled without box integrations, No out of box Ontegrations

9) Security for EventHub is SAS Tokens,Consumer Groups,Namespaces and Managed Privileges, 
Kafka Is : Client Authentication using Kerberos,TLS Client Certificates, Encrypt Network Traffic Via TLS, Authorization Through ACLs

10) High Availability in EventHub is : Replication and availability sets under the hoods to achieve HA and Fault Tolerance,
 Kafka : HA in local Cluster, HA affetects across Global Distributed Regions

11) Coding Paradigms : EVentHub Supports C#,.Net, can also use Java QPID JMS libraries, C or Python Possible Beacuse of QPID Support.

12) Protocol Supports : EVentHub HTTP Rest & AMQP,Kafka Http Rest

13) No On-premise Solution doesn't work in EVentHub

14) $100 for 2.5Billon events, Open Source and free, Pay for the machine and people

15) Tenancy : EVenthub is Multi-Tenancy and Kafka is Single Tenancy

16) DIsaster Recovery : Cross Region Replication, Replication on Azure Storage Unit,Geo-redundancy for Event Hub

Kafka: Replication only between Clusternodes, No easy cross region, Have to use additional software layers like Go Mirror Make tool

17) For Machine critical Applications Either EVenthub or confluent is more suitable than Apache Kafka to get immediate production related issues
